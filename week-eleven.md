# Week Eleven

With the main project well underway, it was time to look at the 'edge of technology' and select something to implement for Milestone Three.

I picked a notification system as I think this could be very beneficial for the auction and event aspects of the project. Users could be notified if:

- they won / lost an auction,
- they were outbid for an aution, or
- an event they were interested in was coming up or changed.

Below is the initial proposal for the notification system.

#### Project Title

Keeping in the Loop: Developing a Push Notification System for an Online Auction Website.

#### Fundamental Project Goal

To investigate and implement a push notification system within a web-application development project.

#### Background

Technology advances at a staggering pace. Staying involved in technological change will be important to develop applications that are current and take advantage of developments in technology.

Push notifications are similar to text messages but limited in size. They allow a business or organization to stay in contact with its online users using a system which is highly automated and allows control by a user to allow, deny, turn on, and turn off the notification service.

There is a range of areas where push notifications could be useful depending on organizational context. Such as push notifications which let users know when something important has occurred (i.e. delivery being made), or as a marketing tool to provide offers.

Ian Blairs article “What is a Push Notification? And Why It Matters” (n.d.) describes how the use of push notifications can increase value in a variety of ways (increasing engagement, retention, and acquisition), but can also have a negative effect if used incorrectly.

Personal experience concludes that push notifications are one area where mobile development is well ahead of web.

#### Project Activities

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What are push notifications and how are they being used in web development?             | Review general relevant online content.                                                 |
| How are push notifications implemented?                                                 | Review general relevant online content. and tutorials. <br>Review package documentation |
| What is the impact of push notifications now and what are the potential future impacts? | Review general relevant online content. <br> Review any relevant academic articles.     |

#### Skills Required

Required skills will depend on the method of push notifications evaluated and selected for use. Expectations for skill requirements include:

- HTML,
- CSS,
- JavaScript, and
- Experience with web frameworks.

#### Anticipated Outcomes

- Project Deliverable: Implementation of a push notification system within a web application.
- Project Report (800 – 1000 words): Formal summary of work undertaken for the project, including:
  - Introduction of push notifications,
  - Description of implementation,
  - Issues faced during the project, and
  - Description of the future impact of push notifications.
