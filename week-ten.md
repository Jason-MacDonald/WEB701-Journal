# Week Ten

## Milestone Two: The End is Nigh!

I managed to somehow finish Milestone Two about a week early :O I considered going back over the prototypes and beefing them up a bit but decided my time would be better spent beginning development of the final project. The main conclusions I drew from Milestone Two is that frameworks are not really capable of enhancing security or user experience on their own, and it is the development on top of the framework that will determine thse aspects.

I still need to do a quick final run through which I will take care of tonight to fix any minor details but the report is essentailly finished at this stage.

## Project

I've been able to make quite a bit of headway on the project. I have the database and server created and communicating with each other, and the client communicationg with the server to retrieve basic test data held in the database. The CRUD functionality of the REST API is setup but not all endpoints are being used in the client yet. I have some CREATES, GETS and an UPDATE but no DELETE functionality.

Once the delete functionality is complete I should be able to add any further requests using previously designd endpoints as a template. Once I have got most of the basic user functionality in place I can move on the the membership, account and authorisation system.

After that is in place (and that coud be a while) I shgould be able to focus on input validation and security, and then finally work on the user interface design.

As part of the final project we need to implement an emerging technology, which could ofcourse be the framework itself (cheating?) however I will look in to this further down the track to see what king of time allowance I have.

I'm definately feeling more comfortable with what I'm doing know in terms of working with frameworks so it will be interesting to see how this all turns out. Hopefully I'll end up with something I can put in my portfolio as many of my projects to date have been relatively unfinished in terms of a production release.
