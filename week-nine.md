# Week Nine

## Linux Box

One of the big focuses at the moment is testing how to deploy applications on a linux box virtual machine. I've had a small play now to become familiar with the virtual machine and processes.

I was able to create a simple Express.js app on the server without any real issues following the tutorial provided in class.

Unfortunately I was having some issues with vue implementation. When trying to install the vue and @vue/cli packages I was getting an error that it could not find a specific file. After loading and unloading all vue packages a few times I decided to install React to see if it indicated an issue with how I was using the server or the NPM packages.

React went through first pop so I had a look around for a way to create a vue app without first needing to install the vue command line.
An npx command was available for just that purpose and I soon had a vue app but no vue cli. For now I will leave it as the actual project will likely be developed locally and then deployed to a server later on in the course. That way it won't need a vue cli install.

## Project

I've finished a big portin of the projet and just have the User Experience section and summaries to finish before tidying it up for submission. I've had some difficulty with the security section and likely the user experience section also as they seem more relevant to CMS than frameworks. Frameworks don't really provide much in the way of live security measures as they dont contain any business logic.

The actual security of the application is going to be influenced by the applied business logic and the security practices used by the developer.

The User Experience is based on users interaction with the app (or in the case of this project, individual prototypes). The problem of course is that the user experience can't be measured very well with such small prototypes. 'Click count to get to an area?' 'error production?' 'error tollerance'.
I will have to take the view of a more complete project and how the frameworks _could_ be used to enhance the different areas.
