# Week Eight

## Security

For our first class for the week, we had a comprehensive overview of what we need to do and resources we can use for the security portion of the project. For the security section we need to evaluate each framework (and any other important sub frameworks, such as npm, database packages etc) to see what measures have been put in to place.

## Project

I haven't made much progress on the framework front since last week, however as I am near completion of a milestone for another class I should find more time this week to finish off the framework prototypes. Which will leave a couple weeks to finish off the documentation for milestone two.

## Linux Box

One of the big focuses at the moment is testing how to deploy applications on a linux box virtual machine. I've had a small play now to become familiar with the virtual machine and processes however I shifted a lot of my focus this week finishing off an assignment due for a seperate class.

My goal for next week will be to create a test development application for the Express and Vue frameworks. As the actual deployment of a site is not required until mileston three, I am taking this a little slowly. The process I will most likely use for deployment involves developing the application locally before deploying rather than developing it on the server.

I'm also fully aware that Assignment One Milestone Two is due in the next few weeks so I am continuing to develop the prototypes which have become much smaller than my initial intentions were :S and reporting about the comparrisons. I still need to put some time into researching the security aspects of each framework aswell.
