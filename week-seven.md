# Week Seven

## Server

We only had one class for week seven where we had a look at connecting to our Linux box which is part of deploying our project in Milestone Three.
I was able to connect to the server using cli ssh and adjust one of the files. After class I also attempted to connect using WinSCP. I was able to connect, however I wasn't able to navigate to the same files as I could using CLI. I will need to look into this further when we touch it again in future classes.

## Project

I've had a small play with svelte and created a prototype testing out most aspects of the functionality, ie user login and administration, artwork administration, bidding and the database (firebase). These were only pushed as far as proof of concept as I still have two other frameworks to consider. I still need to add a web based calculator however this is more of a method rather than anything sophisticated.

My current tasks involve:

- Finishing off the Svelte prototypes (Calculator),
- Creating the Vue prototypes, and
- Expanding on the Express prototypes. (These are reletavily minimal With Express serving mainly as a backend framework)

As always, the repositories for each framework can be found on the [contents page](https://github.com/Jason-MacDonald/WEB701-Journal/blob/master/contents.md).
