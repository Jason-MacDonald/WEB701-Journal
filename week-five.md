# Week Five

So... week five began our journey into Corona Virus.
This means we have missed out on a bit of class time, but it has allowed me some time to really dig in to some of the web technologies. I have played around quite a bit with Vue and related libraries such as

- vuetify for layout and design,
- vuex for state management, and
- axios for async functionality.

I started a project in vue which is coming along nicely and I'm learning a lot along the way. I am definately leaning towards a Vue front-end with an Express backend for the courses practical component.
Last year we were introduced to React, which is basically Vue's big brother, but I had some difficulty understanding certain aspects, especially around Redux (state management).

Vue and Vuex is far more beginner friendly and I have been able to advance much faster with my projects. As a benefit of learning how Vue works, it is also making my understanding of react and redux higher as well. When I eventually go back to react, I can focus on the underlying mechanisms rather than the overall flow which is similar in Vue.

I also started a Laravel project which is a PHP based framework. At first I was completely lost as it is very different from the frameworks I had looked at up to tis point. But as I dug in deeper, I started to see what the benefits of such a framework were. Laravel follows the MVC pattern which is a very solid system for organising code. It can also handle both the front end and backend very easily, and the template creation is absolute bliss. You can simply typr in a few commands and it sets up all the files and templates for a range of functionality.

I really did enjoy working with Laravel but my issue at the moment is that I want to continue with the js frameworks until I have mastered them, or at the very least dont have to rely on tutorials for a good portion of programming.

On an interesting note, searching for laravel on trade me jobs netted me a total of 0 results where as React produced several pages worth.

## Project

My report for Assignment Two, Milestone One is now fully drafted. My next step is to refresh myself on milestone two for the assignment and see if there are any adjustments that need to be made and then put together a plan of attack for the framework analysis portion of the project. I have been able to play around with a wide range of frameworks although I am lacking experience with connecting up to the variety of databases available. I have tried fire base and mysql within web development but I would like to look at MongoDB which is a very popular system that I'm yet to look in to.
