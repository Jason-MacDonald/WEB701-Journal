# Week One

## Session One
The first session of WEB701 involved breaking down the course material to generate an understanding of course requirements. 

We broke into teams to analyse and create a small presentation conveying the course material to the class. The courses overall focus is on evaluation and implementation of modern web frameworks and is broken down into three assignments:
* Journal (10%)
* Analysis and Design (40%)
* Implementation (50%)

I'm looking forward to the content of this course as I really enjoyed the introduction to React, Redux and Express during the previous level 6 WEB class. I did feel however that there were so many frameworks available and I look forward to adding a process for evaluating them to my currently limited tool kit.
