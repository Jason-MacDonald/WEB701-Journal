# Week One

## Session One
The first session of WEB701 involved breaking down the course material to generate an understanding of course requirements. 

We broke into teams to analyse and create a small presentation conveying the course material to the class. The courses overall focus is on evaluation and implementation of modern web frameworks and is broken down into three assignments:
* Journal (10%)
* Analysis and Design (40%)
* Implementation (50%)

I'm looking forward to the content of this course as I really enjoyed the introduction to React, Redux and Express during the previous level 6 WEB class. I did feel however that there are so many frameworks available, and I look forward to adding a process for evaluating them to my currently limited tool kit. 

## Session Two
### Information Architecture
We looked at two short videos that described Information and Architecture.
#### Information
Information is the understanding we gain from analysing a certain set of data and its context. It's not simply the facts that we find, but the details that result by arranging the facts within the provided context to provide an accepted outcome.
#### Information Architecture
Architecture in general refers to the underlying design or structure. 
Information architecture can describe how information should be grouped and how it should link together. For our project we will need to consider grouping of our web content, and the structure of that information to allow easy navigation. Users should be able to navigate to the information quickly and without difficulty. 

## Assignment Two - Milestone One Overview
We analysed the analysis, design and report requirements for Milestone One of Assignment Two. Most of the requirements we will be familiar with from previous study. There was one note given which I will be attempting to follow which is related to our mindset during the design phase. This is to remove the thought process of delegating information to seperate web pages, and group information on its own merits prior to design. This will take some conscious effort as seperating information by page during design has occured naturally in the past.
