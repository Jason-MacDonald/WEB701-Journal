# Week Thirteen

#### Mildly Productive

This I have been finishing off assignments for RES and SDV. With them out of the way I can primarily focus on ilplementation of Push Notifications and tidying up my web app for submission. The main functionality of the website is up and running and I have adjusted a few problems I had with my workflow by targetting the servers repositories to GitHub, so I could work either locally, or through ssh to the server depending on what I needed at the time. I just have to make sure I am pulling any changes if I'm switching the location I'm working from.

Last week I managed to get push working through firefox and then found out that there was a network error causing issues for chrome. This came apparent when I loaded up my project at school to do some debugging and all of the push notifications I had been testing at home finally came through. It's likely that there are ports that need to be configured on the home router to allow notifications to come through on the home network. 

#### Next Step

My next goal is to finish off the input validation on the front end. I may not get to backend validation before the project is due but at least the app won't crash when users try to input invalid details.

I also need to double check edge cases and make sure my error checking is working correctly.

After that I will make sure I have commented anywhere appropriate. I feel most areas should be designed to be reasonably clear in terms of naming and keeping methods small but the notification system is a little more 'prototype' and messy as it's the first time using several different technologies and features such as service workers in the browser and applying the required encryption.

I currently have images being populated randomly via npm faker. I am leaving any further development on this till the end as I have implemented media management through a DBMS throu the SDV course and want to focus on some other areas first. Again, I'm not sure I will get onto this either, but image management will be required next year also with the project I am proposing for my capstone project.

And last but not least, I will need to put together a small report for my push notifications. This is only required to be around 800-1000 words so With all the issues I had, it's going to be a challenge of keeping it short an concise, rather than trying to flesh it out with more detail.
