# Week Six (+2?)

## Project

Finally back on track for the course. My report is completed and am currently waiting for the drop box to open. Now I can start to really dig in to the frameworks for Milestone Two. Our first online class seen a few of our due dates moved so I'll need to update my calander. We also looked over what is required for milestone one of assignment two again, and had another look at milestone two to start thinking about we will need to do as we move forward.

## Frameworks

So far I have familiarised myself with **Express** which is primarily a back-end framework. Its not really capable of anything fancy on the front front end other than throwing up static pages. It is however easy to create endpoints and connect with a range of databases, however other libraries will be required depending n the database chosen.

**Vue** is alot of fun to use, and utilizing the likes of **vuex** for state managment, **vuetify** for styling and **Axios** for async functionality, it takes care of the front end pretty well.

I'm still yet to move on to **Svelte** which unlike traditional frameworks is primarily a comipler. It doesn't use a virtual DOM which is something I'm interested in seeing in practice.

Instead I've been looking into Laravel which I mentioned in my previous blog. This is a very interesting framework which seems to cover most of the development stack within its own environment. Using the cli can quickly generate the templates required which can make programming a lot faster but it is difficult switching between mind sets for the different production flows.

As always, links to the repos for express, vue and svelte are available on the contents page however they are all still a work in progress at the moment.

With analysis and test of express and vue well underway, I really need to get in to svelte so I can see what the new-ish kid on the block has to offer.
