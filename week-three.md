# Week Three

## Identity

These week we started discussing the range of methods available for user **authentication**. I have had a small play with _microservices_ such as **oauth** and **firebase**. Because we have been using alot of JSON lately, I ended up looking into a **JWT**, or _JSON Web Tokens_ for authentication. JWT allows us to securely pass information as a JSON object.

JWT provides a simple to understand system where users can login and generate a token. The token can then be used by the user to authorize access to certain aspects of the web app such as routes or resources while securely passing the information as a JSON object.

I completed [this linked in tutorial tutorial](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-vue-and-node-apps-with-authentication/next-steps?u=76059146) which explained in very simple terms how to impliment this system and was pretty happy with the result. Should I go down the Vue-Express path, this is likely the route I would like to take.

## Frameworks

Much of my out of class time has been spent investigating and testing out **frameworks**. If your reading this then I have hopefully added the links to my repositories from an investigation into Express, Vue, and Svelte to this journals [homepage](https://github.com/Jason-MacDonald/WEB701-Journal/blob/master/contents.md). I will continue to work in the same repositories as I investigate the other areas required for **milestone two** of **assignment two**. The next investigation will be around the **svelte authorisation and login system**. I haven't even touched svelte yet but I'm hoping to be able to use the same Express backend used in the Vue investigation project.

## Assignment Two

My report for assignment has been coming along nicely and I have a draft ready for most aspects of the project. I have the overal content structure in my head but need to get it on to paper and start working on the design aspects. It has been difficult not to think about the app content in terms of pages but as groups of content but it has provided some interesting insights as to how it could be displayed.

Due to the _component nature_ of web frameworks, I can consider the design and content of a particular component, and how that might fit in to the app. As a result, many of my summary components (Components which have a summary of content such as featured auction items) actually find themselves in multiple areas across the site. For example, when the user is viewing a particular event, a filtered summary of other similar events could be displayed nearby.

I have also come across a range of areas that can use a very similar layout or design. It may be difficult to use a single component for different categories such as event, member and auction item, but at the very least it will allow me to use very similar code. Understandably it may be introducing certain **code smells** but that's a problem for a different day.

Over the next week I will hopefully piece together a svelte login system, and flesh out the project report.

## TODO:

- [x] Add list of course repositories the the home page.
- [x] Continue Report.
